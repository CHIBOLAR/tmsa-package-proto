- **Tablet Optimized** (768px - 1199px): Adaptive grid layouts
- **Mobile Responsive** (320px - 767px): Stack-based design with touch-friendly controls
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript (forms still submit)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant with keyboard navigation support

## üéØ Business Logic Implementation

This prototype implements comprehensive training business workflows:

### Package Type Intelligence
- **Ongoing Packages**: Continuous enrollment, day-based scheduling
- **Fixed Packages**: Set duration with session limits and start/end dates
- **Auto-detection**: Package type determined by schedule pattern selection

### Capacity Management
- **Individual Training**: 1-on-1 sessions with personalized booking
- **Group Training**: Min/max capacity with enrollment tracking
- **Dynamic Validation**: Real-time capacity checks and warnings

### Advanced Scheduling
- **Time Slot Management**: Multiple batches per package with independent booking
- **Exception Handling**: Holiday and trainer unavailability management
- **Conflict Detection**: Intelligent scheduling conflict prevention
- **Duration Calculation**: Automatic package duration based on schedule patterns
